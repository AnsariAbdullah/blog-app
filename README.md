### Pass data to another page

NOTE: Found a way around for the above problem. We can use a modal. On click of a post the modal opens with all the data passed in it.
DYNAMIC ROUTES - You can use dynamic routes from react router. Just heard from Jeremy we can use it in ITI Project. Not sure how it works or what it is. Need to do look into it. If dynamic route works the modal can be discarded. 


## Other
- The design seems a bit off you can start with a fresh design and ditch base design (learning all designs is not so important I think)
- Check insta MD for boiler plate code.
- Add series option. i.e. In the footer of the blog the writer can link other blogs/poems thus showing a continuation series.
